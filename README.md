Cartographer
=====

Cartographer is an annotation processor library using Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) for type-safe
Android Jetpack Compose Navigation Graph building.
It removes the need to write all the boiler plate yourself and is designed to be simple and intuitive.

_Note: This is pre-alpha and only the start of the journey._
